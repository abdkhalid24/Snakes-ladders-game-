## Description of the game:

Snakes and Ladders is one of the most famous games that is big fun; it is a perfect game to play with family and friends. Although, with this website game, you can play it anywhere without any issue; you just should have a laptop or any electronic device. Also, you should make sure that you have good “Wi-Fi ”to open the website without any problems. It is a fun and exciting game with some obstacles and some small positives that may lead you to victory with little effort, and it certainly depends on luck because your only weapon will be the dice that you throw.

## Difficult part of the project 
The updatePosition function took a lot of effort and work from me, but in the end I was able to implement it, because it is the part responsible for changing the players’ positions during the game when pressing a button. Among its contents is that you must specify the rows and columns for the container, and also insert the variable responsible for random numbers and others.

## Best part of the project
- The DetectSnakesLadders component is the most beautiful for me, because using the image it provided, I was able to select the head and tail positions for the snakes, as well as the base and top of the ladders. These were placed in variables, and then I started working on the function.
- I also love the design component when working on projects; it truly inspires ideas and creativity you'd never have imagined.

### pseudo code

1. JavaScript:
- The necessary functions were used for logical changes. Two main functions were used: startGame - rollingDice. Each of them constitutes a large part of the project, and both of them are related to each other because some secondary functions overlapped on both sides, and this is necessary in order to run the game.
- Variables also form a large part of the project and are of course required in every java script file. Among these variables I used player positions, snakes and ladders content, sound, and others.


2. HTML:
- The language responsible for linking all files from other languages, and I made the elements appear in the site interface, through which I added the visible texts, and placed the box information for all 100 boxes.
- Head is also a main tag we can use inside it (styles, links, connection with JavaScript and CSS, ...).

3. CSS:
Styles are a big part of the game, as they represent colors, sizes, dimensions, positions, etc. The elements that appear on the screen and the designs are all created through this language. It is truly enjoyable and the most enjoyable language for me out of the three, because it gives you the ability to be creative and come up with unexpected designs.
