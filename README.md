## Description of the game:

The number guessing game is an entertaining game that mostly relies on luck, where the player guesses a number between 1 and 50, and they have 5 attempts. The comments that appear below the writing field will also help them guess the numbers more easily. The game was created using 3 programming languages: HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. So let's get to know more about the game's contents.

## Game contents:
- Game question: The main center of the game, which contains the main reason for creating the game, which is "guess a number between 1 and 50."
- guess box: This is the box that allows the player or user to enter the number he expects between 1 and 50.
- Submission bar: The box responsible for pressing when the number is entered in the guess box to send the number to verify the answer.
- Restart bar: When you press it, the game is restarted again when the round is completed, either by winning or losing.

### pseudo code

1. **JavaScript**:
This language is one of the most popular and important in this project, as it uses some variables related to the numbers and boxes that are clicked, as well as the number of attempts for each player, including the main functions "secretStatement & numberAttempts", each of which is important for running and mastering the game to the fullest.
2. **HTML**:
The standard language used to create and structure content on the web. It defines elements by using tags, In this game, I used it to add text, buttons, and a text field. Most importantly, it combined two functional and design languages: "javascript & CSS".
3. **CSS**:
The language responsible for designing and beautifying the entire project. Through it, I controlled the different sizes of text, standard dimensions, buttons, and main panels.

### Difficult part of the project 
The most difficult part of the project, which took me some time, is the restart mode for the page. When the tour is finished, the restart box is pressed, and then the request occurs. In Java script, I tried many times to link the main function to the run box, but it did not work. In the end, the matter was finally successful.
### Best part of the project
The best part of the game was when I added the design to it. I was more focused on thinking and being creative about this than any other part of the programming.
